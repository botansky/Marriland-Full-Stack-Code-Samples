# Web-Development-Code-Samples
These are code samples that are or will be used in the marriland.com website as original wordpress plugins. To see finished projects go to marriland.com/tools. Some code may be a result of collaboration, but most, if not all cases can essentially be called my work (especially the EXP Calculator and the TeamBuilder Suggestions Algorithm which are 100% mine).

The sole purpose of this repository is to be used as a code samples. Special thanks to @Marriland on Twitter for the fantastic work and experience opportunity!
